Using this json file and instructions could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

I always recomend you validate your files at: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/ and https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

Instructions:

Click the "Code" button and "Download Zip" on the Github Repository and extract the files on your local PC for access.

Ensure your DayZ Server has activated the cfggameplay.json. For console users on Nitrado Servers, go to "General Settings" on your server and tick "Enable cfggameplay.json".

On PC Servers add the following line to your serverDZ.cfg:

enableCfgGameplayFile = 1;

(On some PC servers, including Nitrado, the serverDZ.cfg is "hidden", so you need to enable "expert mode" in settings,
then go to "expert settings", which is the serverDZ.cfg. Stop the server before making changes this way.)

Upload "inception.json" from the extracted files to inside the "custom" folder of the mission directory on your server. This file places the structures on your map.
(If you haven't got a "custom" folder, create one.)

Open the cfggameplay.json file in the correct mission file for your server and look for the "objectSpawnersArr" line.

This file tells your server to access your custom file.

Edit it to look like this: 

	"objectSpawnersArr": ["custom/inception.json"]
	
If you already are calling custom jsons to spawn items, seperate the files like this:

	"objectSpawnersArr": ["custom/inception.json","custom/differentfile.json"]
	
Save your changes & upload if you need to.

Restart your server and the new structures will appear immediatly.

Thanks, Rob.
